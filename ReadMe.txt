Metroid: The Last Orb


Objective: To eliminate zombies and reach the end of the level to acquire an orb to win the game.

Controls: Arrow keys to move and space to shoot.

Common Errors: 

- Collision detection does sometimes gets the character stuck on some weird postions and areas. 
- The zombie will lag and start moving out of the screen of the right side.
- Not being able to jump and up key not working.
- Shooting the zombie but nothing happening. 

I was working on these errors but nothing seems to fix these things from happening. It occurs when the game is run from  someone else's computer but works fine on my own.

Menu was not created due to these errors.
